        <ol>
            <li>Submission leads to primary page, some confusion in finding which was which from the student site</li>
            <li>No spaces or upper-case letters in the file/folder names</li>
            <li>Design:
                <ul>
                    <li>Page has no contrast errors, but contains multiple html errors</li>
                    <li>Page uses a .css file for its styling</li>
                    <li>CRAP:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Contrast: Plugging into webaim I got 0 contrast errors and everything is turning up with no issues</li>
                            <li>Repetition: Page has consitant styling among all pages</li>
                            <li>Alignment: The header being left aligned and the footer being center aligned is a little visually awkward</li>
                            <li>Proximity: The client company name is a little too close to the navigational elements</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Page has a header, footer, main, and nav bar</li>
            <li>Header has the name of the person its for</li>
            <li>Main has an h2 element with the name of the page, name of the site is in the header nav bar a bit redundant with an unnessacery div within the nav however</li>
            <li>Page is has a slogan for their client prompting us to check out their offerings</li>
            <li>Page has footer with the validation button eventhough it is lacking the picture, as well as no css errors</li>
            <li>All pages outside the home page are missing  content</li>

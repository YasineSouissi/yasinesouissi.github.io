        <ol>
            <li>Submission leads to primary page with links to the page to be reviewed</li>
            <li>No spaces or upper-case letters in the file/folder names</li>
            <li>Design:
                <ul>
                    <li>Page has multiple contrast errors as well as other css validation errors, but could do with a media query to increase font size on larger screens</li>
                    <li>Page uses a .css file</li>
                    <li>CRAP:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Contrast: Plugging into webaim I got 5 contrast errors from the heading and footers nav bar</li>
                            <li>Repetition: Page has consitant styling among all pages, however there is a redundant link that is giving a webaim error</li>
                            <li>Alignment: The logo can sometimes block the links on the nav bar when zoomed in</li>
                            <li>Proximity: Barring the issues with the logo covering a link the proximity between links and the heading look good</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Page has a header, footer, main, and nav bar</li>
            <li>Header has the name of the person its for but a relatively inconsistent theme between photography and tea</li>
            <li>Main has an h2 element with the name of the page, name of the site is in the header nav bar cant access the code for the other pages nearly as easily</li>
            <li>Page is missing a slogan for their client</li>
            <li>Page has footer with the validation button as well as no css or html errors</li>
            <li>All pages are missing any content</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Dead Weight | TBA</h3>
        <div>
            <img src="images/deadweightplchlder.PNG" alt="dead weight poster?">
            <p>Step onto the dance floor and into the suspenseful world of "Dead Weight," a gripping short film set against the glitz and glamour of prom night. As the evening unfolds, tensions simmer beneath the surface, and secrets threaten to unravel amidst the dazzling lights and elegant gowns. With each dance step and whispered conversation, the stakes soar higher, leading to a climax that will leave audiences on the edge of their seats.
                Dead weight is an upcoming project that I directed, hence why theres no video yet. I am very excited for it to release but am still in the process of editing it.
